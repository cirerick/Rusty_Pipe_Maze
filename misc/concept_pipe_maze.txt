--initialize 2 dimensional array
--start from bottom of first path. 
1. loop
2. print '|' and then three ' ' until last col is reached	
	Ex. [|][ ][ ][ ][|]
3. Go to the next to row above to print a bridge
4. every 4th elem is a path, look for node id of 0 or 1 <- increment by 1 after
	1. when node is found on that path print O---O
	2. then keep printing '|' until the last col is met,
4. loop again



So for every 4th elm print |, otherwise ' '
